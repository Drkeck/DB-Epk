                I am DeceptiveBrownie, the new name in melodic electronica. Everything you hear is composed and produced by yours truly.

                <br />
                I’m working at all times to release a song, either a cover or original, once a month with an album set to release per year. With time and support, I’ll be able to expand my sound and improve the quality of every track.
                <br />
                <br />
                My goal is to provide calm, cool sounds. A lounge of soft ambiance or some tunes for relaxing, along with some resonant beats and atmospheric bass lines.
